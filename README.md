# Supreme Auto Filler

A Chrome extension that fills in the checkout page of [Supreme](https://www.supremenewyork.com)

## About the Project
This project is my first Chrome extension project. It allows for a speedy checkout by filling in the checkout details automatically. Within the extension you are able to fill in the same checkout form prior to a release, save the profile and load it.

## Installation
To use the Chrome extension, please follow the steps below:

1. Install the Chrome browser
2. Go to the address: `chrome://extensions`
3. Enable `Developer mode` (found on the top right of the screen)
4. Click the `Load unpacked` button and select the folder housing the chrome extension
5. The extension should be installed and you can use it!
